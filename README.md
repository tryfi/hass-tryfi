This allows you to integrate [TryFi](https://tryfi.com) Smart GPS Collars with Home Assistant.

**Note:** This integration includes an embedded version of the pytryfi library, so no separate installation is required.

## Features
Current functionality includes:
* Device Tracker - your pet will show up in HA using the GPS coordinates from the collar
* Step Counter - it will report your pets daily, weekly, and monthly steps
* Distance Counter - it will report your pets daily, weekly and monthly distance
* Battery Level - it will report your Pet's collar battery level
* Battery Charging - it will report if your Pet's collar is charging
* Collar Light - you can control the light on the collar by turning it on and off and setting the color
* Lost Dog Mode - allows you to select Lost mode if your dog if it is lost and select Safe if it is found
* Bases - reports the status of the base (online/offline)

# How to Use
## Light Collar
The light on your Pet's collar is represented as a light switch in HA. It can either be turned on or off.
The color can be set. The collar only supports Red, Green, Blue, LightBlue, Purple, Yellow, and White. The closest color to your selection will be used.

## Lost Dog Mode
TryFi is equiped with a "Lost Dog Mode" functionality. In HA this is represented by a select entity.
Select Lost if your pet is lost or Safe if your pet is OK.
